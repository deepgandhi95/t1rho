Performs T1-rho parametric mapping given t1-rho DICOM images using different spin lock times and outputs T1 rho map with pixel values which have greater than 98% Ajusted R-squared values. Also contains a matlab script T1rhoQC.m which performs QC of the fitted T1rho data.

Requirements:
MATLAB 2020b or later

Usage:
